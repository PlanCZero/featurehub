FeatureHub is a platform to help software teams manage their features,
from feature flags (also known as feature toggles) to A/B experiments and remote or
centralised configuration management.  It's an essential ingredient for enabling the feedback loop see diagram below.

Building software with feature management encourages DevOps practices like
http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com[trunk based development], continuous delivery and importantly,
separating deployment from releasing. Enabling teams to deliver value to customers early and often,
whilst maintaining high quality and keeping risk low.

FeatureHub can be used with small startups through to large enterprises
with many applications and teams.  It's has an enterprise grade security and permission model, that's
intuitive and easy to use, so you can be up and running quickly.

== Getting started

Full documentation can be found at https://docs.featurehub.io[docs.featurehub.io]

Out of the box FeatureHub uses Docker, to start simply run the following docker command

`docker run featurehub`

[NOTE]
You'll need to https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[install Docker] first.

Once running, open up a browser and head to http://localhost:5000 there you can kick off the initial setup.

There are several deployment options depending on your use case,
we strongly recommend reading about these options in the https://docs.featurehub.io[documentation].

For advanced users who want to run the stack from scratch,
please see the <<docs/developers.adoc, developer docs>> for more details.
