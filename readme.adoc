FeatureHub is a Cloud Native platform to help software teams manage their features. This is the
primary source code repository for FeatureHub - if you want to help us resolve any outstanding
issues, contribute a new SDK or just get a deeper understanding of how it works, this is the right place to be.

We selectively take cuts of this repository and build them into docker image sets. We then
update the main https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub-install[install repository] with the latest
images and issues tags on that repository.

== The Code

If you have reviewed the https://docs.featurehub.io/architecture.html[Architecture section] of the FeatureHUb 
documentation you will notice there are several parts. It is designed this way because FeatureHub is designed
to scale from a small one person, one application option all the way to large organisations serving billions
of requests for features per day. That has also affected our language and deployment choices. 

=== The backend servers 

The Management Repository, Dacha (the Cache layer) and Edge (where all clients connect
via their service accounts) are all written in Java. That is where our experience in writing massively scalable
software lies, so we stuck it what we know. In our simple examples, it all deploys together in one simple 
bundle. In complex examples it can all be sliced apart, sharded and massively scaled. If you want to
contribute to the backend, you will need to know Java. We use a few other technologies as well which will
help OpenAPI, JAX-RS (specifically Jersey), Maven (specifically with Maven Tiles), and Ebean for our ORM.

If you want to go deep, we also support Prometheus, Health Checks, OpenTracing and Jaeger. This is an 
enterprise-ready stack where you can easily ignore all that stuff if you aren't interested. But if you have
operations people and they want it, it is there.

=== The Admin UI

The Admin front end is written in Flutter Web. Again, going with what we are best at, with highly honed Flutter skills,
we chose to not spread our load too wide. We are happy with this choice currently as it gives us a wide range
of platforms (Flutter Web, mobile, native platforms) we can target from the same codebase. If you want
to contribute to the Admin UI - Flutter is where we are at.

=== The SDKs

The SDKs have their own section, and each seeks to be an idiomatic representation of their own
language. We recommend you head to the link:sdks/README.adoc[SDKs section] to learn more about it. If
you are planning on helping us by building an SDK in a language we don't yet support, we have another
document that details what everything means. We are happy to get contributions that slowly add full
functionality for a new language. 

== Contributing

FeatureHub is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community!
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into FeatureHub itself.
