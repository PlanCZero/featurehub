== DB API

This is the data model for the Management Repository, and it is intentionally focused around what ebean
is capable of. Ebean allows us to annotate the database model with required information which can be ignored
if being used with another database set of infrastructure. 

It is done for simplicity of maintenance and performance so there isn't a REST model, a database intermediate 
model and then an actual database model which will for the 99% use case, be the same.

In the future if it is a problem, we can get around it via code generation.
