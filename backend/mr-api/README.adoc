=== Notes

The tag `AllowedDuringPasswordReset` has special meaning. It means this API is allowed to be called by a person
who has been authenticated when `passwordRequiresReset` is tagged against their account. This means that
a person has to be both logged in _and_ in that mode to access the API.
